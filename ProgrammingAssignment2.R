#  Assignment: Caching the Inverse of a Matrix
#
#  Week 03 John Hopkins R Programming Coursera Course
#  
#  Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and their may be some benefit to 
#  caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly 
#  Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

#  Write the following functions:
#  makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
#  cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix
#              above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
#              then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.


#  Creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = array()) {
   m <- NULL
   set <- function(y) {
      x <<- y
      m <<- NULL
   }
   get <- function() x
   setinverse <- function(solve) m <<- solve
   getinverse <- function() m
   list(set = set, get = get,
        setinverse = setinverse,
        getinverse = getinverse)
}

#  Computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix.
#  If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
#  then the cachesolve retrieves the inverse from the cache.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
   m <- x$getinverse()
   if(!is.null(m)) {
      message("getting cached data")
      return(m)
   }
   data <- x$get()
   m <- solve(data, ...)
   x$setinverse(m)
   m
}
